    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people perceive real-world visual scenes like this:

    <strong>Procedures</strong>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    If you agree to take part in this study, you will be presented with a series of image pairs of real-world scenes like the pair below:
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://alanzhihaolu.github.io/changeBlindness/FChange/fcb02/main/Images/example_a.jpg" style="width: 360px; height: 270px;">
    <img src="https://alanzhihaolu.github.io/changeBlindness/FChange/fcb02/main/Images/example_b.jpg" style="width: 360px; height: 270px;">
    <br>
    <span style="text-align: center;"><i>Example Image Pair</i></span>
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    You will see the two images in the pair alternate very quickly, with a very quick flicker between the images.
</p>
 
<p>
    <br>
    Between the pair of images, there will always be an element that will change:
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    Your task will be to find this change as quickly as possible, using a mouse and a keyboard.
    As soon as you find the change, press the spacebar once to stop the images from alternating. 
    Then, use your mouse to click on the location of the change.
</p>

<p>The experiment consists of 120 scenes and will take approximately 30 minutes or less.<br>This study will be conducted with an online Qualtrics-created survey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risks/Discomforts</strong><br>
Risks are minimal for involvement in this study. The only foreseeable risk in this study is the possiblity of boredom.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compensation</strong><br>
Participants will earn 0.5 SONA credits if they complete&nbsp;all 120 trials of the&nbsp;task. Completed items are those that are rated in good faith by a human observer. Participants selecting all of the same rating and/or&nbsp;randomly selecting ratings (i.e., 'spamming') will not receive credit.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong><br>
There are no direct benefits for participants besides the SONA credit. However, it is hoped that through your participation, researchers will learn more about how we visually process complex visual scenes.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
All data obtained from participants will be kept strictly confidential and will only be reported in an aggregate format (by reporting only combined results and never reporting individual ones). All questionnaires will be concealed, and no one other than then primary investigator and assistant researches listed below will have access to them. The data collected will be stored in the HIPPA-compliant, secure database until it has been deleted by the primary investigator.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Institution Review Board (IRB) Approved</b><br>
An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at the University of California, Davis reviewed this research project and found it to be acceptable according to applicable state and federal regulations and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
